Federal and state governments often \\nuse these estimates to allocate funds to local com-\\nmunities. Government agencies, researchers, and local organizations regularly use these estimates to identify the number of individuals and families eligible for vari-ous programs and to measure economic well-being.\\nThis brief uses the 2021 and 2022 American \\nCommunity Survey (ACS) 1-year estimates and the \\n2021 and 2022 Puerto Rico Community Surveys \\n(PRCS) to analyze poverty rates for calendar year 2022, as well as the changes in poverty from calen-dar year 2021 for the nation, states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs).\\n1, 2\\nThis brief also discusses the distribution of people  by income-to-poverty ratios for the aforementioned \\n1 Metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs or metro areas) are \\ngeographic entities delineated by the Office of Management and \\nBudget (OMB) for use by federal statistical agencies in collecting, \\ntabulating, and publishing federal statistics. A metro area contains \\na core urban area with a population of 50,000 or more individuals. \\nFor more information, refer to <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/\\nmetro-micro/about/omb-standards.html>.\\n² The U.S. Census Bureau reviewed this data product for \\nunauthorized disclosure of confidential information and has \\napproved the disclosure avoidance practices applied to this release. \\nCBDRB-FY23-0175.

No state had a poverty rate increase from 2021 to 2022. Poverty rates did not change in 41 states and Puerto Rico. Poverty rates in states and the District \\nof Columbia ranged from 7.2 percent to 19.1 percent. \\n• In 5 of the 25 most populous metropolitan areas, \\nthe poverty rate decreased between 2021 and 2022. The Minneapolis MSA was the only metro area among the 25 most populous metropolitan areas that saw poverty increase, from 8.0 percent to 8.8 \\npercent.\\n• In 2022, 6.1 percent of people nationally had income \\nbelow 50 percent of their poverty threshold, which was not statistically different from the 2021 rate of 6.2 percent. The share of individuals living below 50 percent of poverty decreased in 10 states and the \\nDistrict of Columbia and increased in 4 states. \\n3 The data collection period for the 2021 ACS spanned January to \\nDecember 2021; the data collection period for the 2022 ACS spanned \\nJanuary to December 2022.\\n4 Following the standard specified by OMB in Statistical Policy \\nDirective 14, data from the Current Population Survey Annual Social Economic Supplement are used to estimate the official \\nnational poverty rate that can be found in the report “Poverty in \\nthe United States: 2022,” available at <www.census.gov/library/\\npublications/2023/demo/p60-280.html>.
